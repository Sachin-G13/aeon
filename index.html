<!-- Our DNS provider does not support ALIAS or ANAME records. Readthedocs does not provide stable IP addresses, so we cannot use A records either. To still serve our aeon-toolkit.org apex domain, we create a dummy website on GitHub pages which redirects to our subdomain www.aeon-toolkit.org which points to Readthedocs.-->
