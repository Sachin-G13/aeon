    "# Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) with aeon\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Series Regression (TSR) involves training a model from a collection of time\n",
    "series (real valued, ordered, data) in order to predict a continuous target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of TSR.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Time Series Forecasting Regression (TSFR) relates to forecasting reduced to regression\n",
    "through a sliding window. This is the more familiar type to most people. The notebook\n",
    "for forecasting using supervised regressors can be found [here](../forecasting/forecasting_sklearn.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Time Series *Extrinsic* Regression (TSER) was formally specified in Tan et al. [1] as a\n",
    "related, but distinct, type of time series regression problem. Rather than being derived from a\n",
    "forecasting problem, TSER involves a predictive model built on time series to predict a real-valued\n",
    "variable distinct from the training input series.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on the `aeon` regression module, which consists of algorithms for TSER.\n",

    "<img src=\"img/tser.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"time series regression\">\n",
    "\n",
    "An example TSER problem is shown in the below image of soil spectrograms which can be used to estimate\n",
    "the potassium concentration. Ground truth is found through expensive\n",
    "lab based experiments that take some time. Spectrograms (ordered data series we treat as time series)\n",
    "are cheap to obtain and the data can be collected in any environment. An accurate regressor from spectrogram\n",
    "to concentration would make land and crop management more efficient.\n",
